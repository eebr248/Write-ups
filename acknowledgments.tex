\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge that this research was partially supported by the University Research Grant Committee (URGC) award from Clemson University.
First of all, I wish to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Sabarish Babu for his consistent support even before the start of my PhD. He believed in me and gave me the opportunity to blossom. He never deprived me of his time and advice even during his tightest schedules. I have also had the pleasure of working with Dr. Christopher Pagano and Dr. Andrew Robb benefiting from their expertise in my research. Their consistent advice and encouragement kept me more motivated in overcoming the research obstacles. Furthermore, I would take the opportunity to appreciate invaluable suggestions that I received from Dr. Larry Hodges during the last 4 years which greatly benefited my experiments. Last but not the least, I owe a debt of gratitude to my family, husband and friends who have always earnestly devoted their moral support and time in my hour of need.
